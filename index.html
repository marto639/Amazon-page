                    Long gone are the good old days when a cat’s biggest worries were mean dogs or a bath. Modern cats
                    must
                    confront satanists, online predators, the possibility of needing to survive in a post-apocalyptic
                    wasteland, and countless other threats to their nine lives.

                    For over four decades, the American Association of Patriots have stood at the vanguard of our
                    country's defense by helping to prepare our nation's cat owners for the difficult conversations they
                    dread having with their pets.

                    Written in a simple Q&A format, How to Talk to Your Cat About Gun Safety answers crucial questions
                    such as, “What is the right age to talk to my cat about the proper use of firearms?” and “What are
                    the benefits of my cat living a lifestyle of abstinence?” and especially “Why does my cat need to
                    use the internet? Can’t he just play with yarn like cats used to do?”
